# Hawley2022

Code used to generate the results in the Paper 'Dynamic switching of lateral inhibition spatial patterns' Joshua Hawley, Paul Glendinning, Nancy Papalopulu (2022).
Code written in MATLAB.

To run the simulation once and reproduce most of the figures in the paper, open and run the file 'SingleRun.m'.

To run multiple repeats over a range of parameters, open and run either 'ParameterSpace_Fig7and8.m' or 'ParameterSpace_SuppFig2and3.m'. To avoid running this code for a long time, workspaces that contain simulation outputs used in the paper are accessible within the folder 'Workspaces used to generate figures in paper'. With either 'ParameterSpace_Fig7and8.m' or 'ParameterSpace_SuppFig2and3.m', the workspace should be loaded and then the Plot section should be run lower down in the scripts.
